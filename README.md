# README for Seattle Crime Data

The purpose of this project is to show how to use different Python mapping libraries to perform some non-trivial mapping. The idea for this project came from [a Domino blog post on folium](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/creating-interactive-crime-maps-with-folium/). This used an older version of Folium, which is **not** compatible with the current version.

Hopefully this project will provide an idea of the advantages and disadvantages of the different mapping packages for Python, as well as act as an example of how to use each package.

## Mapping packages looked at

* Basemap

* Plot.ly

* Bokeh

* Folium

* Geoplotlib

* Kartograph.py


## Project structure

## Data sources
The data was obtained on April 17th from the [Seattle police department](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Seattle-Police-Department-Police-Report-Incident/7ais-f98f) dataset from [data.seattle.gov].
